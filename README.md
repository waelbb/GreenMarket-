# GreenMarket Project Report

## I. Context

### Project Summary
GreenMarket is an initiative aimed at creating an online platform dedicated to the sale of clothing exclusively from eco-friendly brands. These brands are rigorously selected for their adherence to four fundamental pillars: Humanity, Health, Environment, and Animals. Our goal is to provide consumers with a reliable and convenient source to acquire clothing that respects these values.

### Origin of the Idea
The idea for GreenMarket stems from a growing consumer awareness of the impact of their consumption habits, particularly in the fashion sector. In response to the proliferation of fast fashion, more and more people are seeking to support ethical and ecological brands but face major obstacles.

## II. Problem

### Challenges of Eco-Responsible Consumption
The main challenge that GreenMarket aims to overcome is the difficulty for consumers to find clothing from genuinely eco-responsible brands. The encountered obstacles include:

- **Lack of Visibility**: Eco-responsible brands are often less visible than major fast fashion labels.
- **Complexity and Time**: Searching for ethical clothing requires a lot of time and effort, deterring many consumers.

### Impact of Fast Fashion
Fast fashion poses significant environmental and ethical problems, such as:

- **Environmental Impact**: Excessive use of resources and waste production.
- **Social and Ethical Issues**: Precarious working conditions and negative impact on the health of workers and communities.
- **Animal Mistreatment**: Use of raw materials from wildlife, often under cruel and inhumane conditions, particularly for the production of leather, wool, and fur.

## III. Hypothesis

### Implementation Strategy
To build our product catalog, we will adopt a web scraping approach. This involves extracting relevant information from eco-responsible brand websites.

### Targeted Sites for Scraping
- **Montlimart**: A key player in the sustainable fashion market.
- **Dedicatedbrand**: A brand recognized for its commitment to ethical practices.
- **Circlesportswear**: An innovative company in the field of eco-responsible sportswear.

### Objectives of Scraping
- **Information Collection**: Extract detailed data on each product, including:
  - Product link
  - Brand name
  - Price
  - Product photo
  - Product name
  - Product release date

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure frequent data updates to reflect the latest collections and information.
